   matrix artifacts taxonomies about resources contribute faq blog      Taxonomies inside the D3FEND Ontology Taxonomies are an essential concept in knowledge management. They capture hierarchical information into a tree-like structure. The most common "type" of taxonomy is a type hierarchy. For example, a car is a type of vehicle, and a vehicle is a physical object. Another type of taxonomy, called a mereology, is a hierarchy of composition. For example, a tire is part of a wheel which is part of a car. D3FEND has many taxonomies inside its ontology, which is a graph-like structure. This page includes a variety of taxonomies in D3FEND, but not all. This is intended to orient you to the type of information in the D3FEND ontology. You can imagine how all these concepts relate to each other, and other things like offensive techniques, defensive techniques, and even weaknesses or vulnerabilities. This is the sort of information we aim to organize and interrelate with the D3FEND ontology.
